# TFG-LARVA
Final grade project for my computers engineering degree (no commits).

LARVA, Learning Analytics Recollection & Visualization Agents, is a project created
by Luis Castillo Vidal. This project, integrated in the subject DBA (Agent Based
Development), uses the magentix platform, a JAVA library developed by the Universidad
Polit√©cnica de Valencia, in order to create and communicate agents.
Through these agents, students develop skills to improve in the design, resolution and
planning of problems created by that teacher. Meanwhile, the teacher uses his own
agent to collect information about the students' development in solving these problems.

However, this project was designed and developed in such a fashion that it was the
fastest way to integrate it into the subject. Because of this, the project had many
issues and every year questionnaires were provided by the teacher to the students
to ask the for opinions about it. 

This final project will try to give it a boost. To do this, the entire architecture 
will be redesigned, in order to solve the problems it presents at the moment, while 
adding new features, such as the privatization of students or visualization on 
mobiles, and finally, facilitating future alterations and/or additions to it, 
thanks to a design based on the low coupling and high cohesion.
